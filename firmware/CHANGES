Changes for release 9 (14th October 2012)

* CPM/CPS autoswitching - enabled from settings.
* serial interface to probe magsensor.

* serial interface to set MICIPHONE and MICREVERSE

Changes for release 8 (8th October 2012)

* dialog display, for log clearing report etc.
* When the log is full flash up a "log full" dialog on occurrence and on boot - implemented, requires testing.
* pressing for lock should not trigger a key press, trigger key presses on key release only.
* enhanced lock functionality - press two keys to lock, "back and select".
* Brightness changing starts from current brightness level.
* Ability to set log interval (default to 30mins)
* Splash screen with Safecast and Medcom logos
* Bug: Save icons for some items have weird names like "SaveBecq" or "SaveWarn" they should all just save "Save"
* log reading/writing broken
* Backing out from changing brightness would leave the brightness set at the level currently being selected. Fixed so it reverts to the
+old level.
* make program target to flash the firmware
* Modify linker to leave space at the beginning of the code region of private key
* help screen framework
* device tag, settable over serial
* splash screen shows firmware release and devicetag
* remove sieverts estimated - pieter
* jam detection 7.7KHz signal - the logic I've added here is that when the CPM goes above 350000 the system prints "TOO HIGH" for all
+values. This may not be ideal, but possibly better than nothing. Next time I'm playing with a disassembled device I will test/rework
+this.
* 3 d.p. on all displayed values
* Bug: Warning level exceed message is blocking, this means that when the warning is shown, data logging will not take place. Rework
+this.

Changes for release 7 (4th October 2012)

* Japanese language support
* smoothing to reduce jitter on battery icon
* tick box for some toggle menu items (audio on/off)
* screen dims after 10 seconds of inactivity
* serial interface for debugging.
* bugfix: in aggregate/avg mode, average CPM can leave artefacts on screen
* bugfix: black line in the middle of the battery icon - after many hours of debugging, appears to be display fault on my unit. Need to verify this.
* Support for Roentgens display instead of Sieverts
* Becquerel mode
* Add additional Japanese language translations.
* bugfix: it's occasionally possible to jump out of the current screen and back to home without trigger a screen clear. I'm not sure what triggers this bug. Requires further investigation. --- Appears to be triggered by pressing both back and home at the same time.
* bugfix: If I mash buttons a lot I can get the header and other display items to stop working.
*bugfix: in settings, brightness. When selected the SaveBrightness item causes a flashing box to appear where the lock icon is.
