Safecast Geiger Counter Firmware loader
---------------------------------------

You need to unload ftdi_sio and usbserial for this program to work.

This program requires the FTDI drivers, these are shipped in binary form under a closed source license by FTDI. A copy is included in this package, in the libftd2xx1.1.0 directory. This loader also uses stm32ld, a copy of which is also embedded in this package.


You need to unload the system FTDI serial drivers from the firmware loader to run, so a complete run might be as follows:

git clone git@github.com:Safecast/onyxfirmware.git
cd onyxfirmware/firmware_loader/
sudo rmmod ftdi_sio
sudo rmmod usbserial
./fwload -f safecast_r5.bin
sudo modprobe usbserial
sudo modprobe ftdi_sio

There is also bash script called 'load' that can be used to program firmware.
user@host:~/onyxfirmware/firmware_loader$ ./load ../firmware/firmware-12.12.bin
